# Git Draw
Allows you to draw in your GitHub heatmap

![demo-vid](https://github.com/ben174/git-draw/raw/master/media/demo-video.gif)

This is a Chrome extension which will allow you to freely draw on your GitHub
heatmap. You can then export your drawing to a script containing a git commit
log. Once you've run and pushed this script to a new repository, your commit
log will match the drawing you made.
